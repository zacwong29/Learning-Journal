# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
In this week's practical, I knew it would be pretty easy to make a basic website, as I had done it only last year in CP1406. Since I'm only a second year, I found 
it quite daunting when I heard that in this third year subject, I would have to learn some of the content on my own through online research (as I was used to the lecture ->
seminar -> practical -> lecture -> seminar etc. pattern from last year). With this subject being seemingly more 'free', as opposed to just following the resources provided
in the subject, I knew I needed to have a different mindset.

I gained most of this subject information from the introduction and lecture video of CP3402 in LearnJCU. After this, I did the small revision quiz to refresh on CP1406
content. This helped me a bit, but I realised I had forgotten a lot of the theory from that subject. So, I quickly skimmed through the PowerPoint slides from the CP1406 
subject on LearnJCU. Later, I checked the GitHub calendar, resources and learning journal sections. I tried watching the LinkedIn video from the calendar section, but realised
I needed an account, so I did not watch it yet. Because of this, I missed some valuable learning from that video, and it made the process of revising website development a
little bit more cumbersome. I ended up just reviewing a lot of my CP1406 assignments and practicals to get an idea for my website.

After about halfway through my practical 1 website development, I watched the LinkedIn video (realising I could just use my JCU email through LinkedIn Learning). This provided
great insight that helped refresh my knowledge and theory of website development.
