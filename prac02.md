# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
First, I went to our subject's seminar and learnt more about CMSs. For hosting, I used Cloudaccess.net and learnt how to use their Cloud Control Panel by watching their
website tour videos. Next, I watched the LinkedIn video that explained the WordPress basics. I watched a newer video (suggested by LinkedIn Learning) than the one provided 
in our GitHub section since the newer one would have a more recent WordPress interface to follow. While following along with the 'Wordpress basics' tutorial, I uploaded an image to my WordPress site and decided to learn more about the 'alt' descriptions for images and how and when to use them. Later on, I found and watched a 'Joomla basics'
video/course on LinkedIn Learning.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 10 hours learning.

## Content Insights
Before using the CMSs, I figured they would not require using HTML or CSS anymore. However, while using the Joomla CMS, I realised that in order to change the style of a template (such as container colours), some of the CSS files needed to be added to. It seems that structure/HTML is mainly dealt with using the Joomla administrator widgets/interface, and styling or colours are dealt with using the CSS files. Meanwhile, from my limited time in WordPress, it seems that the styling/colours can be changed quite a lot with just the WordPress interface/tools (hence, not having to deal with the HTML/CSS files as much).

In Joomla, I found it difficult to understand the difference between using 'Articles' and 'Site Modules'. I knew modules were positioned within an article, however it seemed like I wasn't really adding any content to the 'Article' sections itself. I was only adding content inside the site modules sections. After some research, I found that site modules are typically used when you have repeated content that can use similar modules, either on one page only or on multiple pages. Adding content into the 'Article' module is only used when you want to add information directly to the main body of the page (like an article or in the start-up business scenario: about the team information).
