# Week 3

## Learning Activities & Resources
First, I went to the seminar and had some group discussions with fellow classmates about good teamwork skills. I also got an introduction into DevOps and local development environments. Next, I watched the WordPress workflows LinkedIn video (newer version). Notably during the practical session, I did a short interview with three other classmates to determine whose teamwork style would fit my own. The interview results are below.

Interview results

Nick:
- Not available Wed, Thu
- Wants to achieve an HD grade
- No preference for online and/or in-person meetup.

Cheyenne:
- Not available Wed, Sat, Sun
- Wants to achieve an HD grade (is okay with pass)
- No preference for online and/or in-person meetup.

Dean:
- Potentially not available Mon, Fri
- Wants to achieve an HD grade
- Prefers online meetups, but is open to in-person meetups.

Myself (for reference):
- Preferably not Mon, Tue (due to uni classes taking up most of day)
- Wants to achieve an HD grade
- No preference for online and/or in-person meetup.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 2 hours learning.

## Content Insights
I have found that using templates/patterns in WordPress is very useful for efficiency and consistency between pages (similar to creating a home page in HTML then copying it for other pages). Previously, adding the same elements to multiple pages was tedious. Furthermore, I learnt about utilising multiple environments for development including the live and local environments. One for publically showing the site and one for locally working on pages before launch. This is something that could help me in the coming weeks.

Considering my interview results above, I would consider any of these classmates as good team members. However, they all have differing days of availability, which may make it difficult to have a meeting if all of us were in a group together. We all share the same grade goal of HD and all seem to be okay with either online or in-person meetings.

Furthermore, I learnt some better questions from other classmates' interviews such as asking about strengths/weaknesses or team roles. I would definitely consider these now and when I do other group projects.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
For the first two weeks, I had been writing handwritten notes from the lecture video and LinkedIn Learning videos. The lecture video was manageable, but the LinkedIn learning videos were very long, and writing notes just added to that length. For this week, I tried writing notes in a Word document, which was quicker and did not drain my motivation as much.

I used ChatGPT a few times to understand how WordPress works. However, next week I want to make sure that I try to look for more proper tutorials about WordPress before just utilising ChatGPT.
