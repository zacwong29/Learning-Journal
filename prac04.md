# Week 4

## Learning Activities & Resources
First, I attended the seminar and learnt about the three environments for web development. Next, I learnt a bit about Docker and how it works using the welcome tutorial on the Docker Desktop app. Then I dived into the Trello management app and tried to understand how it is used via the Trello tutorials. Finally, I watched some of one of the LinkedIn Learning videos provided.

- Mapping the Modern Web Design Process - Morten Rand-Hendriksen (LinkedIn Learning video): https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mapping-the-modern-web-design-process/create-great-informational-user-experiences?u=2223545

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 3 hours learning.

## Content Insights
While using Docker, I was slowly starting to understand the workflow of using local environments and then pushing to a live server.

I also found it important to consider the site owner's use of the website, as well as the user's use. There could be a 'manager' page as well that allows the owner of the company/establishment to manage their assets or view their company statistics or deal with customers.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I was not able to view all of the provided LinkedIn videos this week as there more of them than usual. I do plan on catching up on them; especially the version control one, as I think it will be very useful for later. I think I need to plan out more time for these videos. I also found it hard to concentrate on them, since I was mainly worried about the length of the practical.
