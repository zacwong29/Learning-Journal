# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
I watched the introduction and lecture video of CP3402 in LearnJCU. I revised CP1406 content with the revision quiz. I watched a quick YouTube video online that summarised the basics of Web Development. After this, I quickly skimmed through the PowerPoint slides from the CP1406 subject on LearnJCU. I tried watching the LinkedIn video from the calendar section, but realised I needed an account, so I did not watch it yet. I ended up just reviewing a lot of my CP1406 assignments and practicals to remember syntax and semantics. However, after about halfway through my practical 1 website development, I watched the LinkedIn video (realising I could just use my JCU email through LinkedIn Learning). Furthermore, I attended the seminar at Cairns JCU and learnt some history on various technologies. Lastly, I spent time to learn how GitHub Pages works via the documentation.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 7 hours learning.

## Content Insights
Revising HTML and CSS helped me remember a lot of my old habits with website building. I also managed to change a couple of these through the LinkedIn video i watched. One notable experience was when I realised that the \<section> tag was used for chapters or news items (not just any random section of the webpage - which I used to think).

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In this week's practical, I knew it would be pretty easy to make a basic website, as I had done it only last year in CP1406. Since I'm only a second year, I found 
it quite daunting when I heard that in this third year subject, I would have to learn some of the content on my own through online research (as I was used to the lecture ->
seminar -> practical -> lecture -> seminar etc. pattern from last year). With this subject being seemingly more 'free', as opposed to just following the resources provided
in the subject, I knew I needed to have a different mindset.

I did the small revision quiz to refresh on CP1406 content. This helped me a bit, but I realised I had forgotten a lot of the theory from that subject. So, I knew I needed to revise this more. Furthermore, since I did the LinkedIn learning later than I should have (I watched it halfway through the practical), I missed some valuable learning from that video, and it made the process of revising website development a little bit more cumbersome. However, after watching the video, I felt that it provided great insight that helped refresh my knowledge and theory of website development. It also gave me a good introduction to content management systems.

The videos and CP1406 PowerPoint provided a good start for me to revise, but I found just writing my prac 1 website code was very beneficial to my revision. Given that I was worried in the beginning about doing my own research, I'm now finding it to be okay. I've been looking at documentation and following instructions well in my opinion. Furthermore, after utilising GitHub Pages to host my website, I felt more confident with GitHub, and now knew how to host any website on this platform.

From the LinkedIn video, I learnt that there are many jobs in web development - both code and no-code work. I definitely like making websites with coding, so this would be a potential job I'm interested in pursuing. As discussed earlier, I feel like I'm still transitioning from the lecture -> seminar -> practical pattern of learning. Whilst it is still similar, it seems there is a lot more learning involved. With the pattern being like so now: lecture -> LinkedIn video -> other research -> seminar -> practical, it definitely has felt like a lot of work, not even considering my other subjects. However, I think I will be able to manage my time better next week.
