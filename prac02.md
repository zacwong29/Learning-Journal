# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
First, I went to our subject's seminar and learnt more about CMSs. For hosting, I used Cloudaccess.net and learnt how to use their Cloud Control Panel by watching their
website tour videos. Next, I watched the LinkedIn video that explained the WordPress basics. I watched a newer video (suggested by LinkedIn Learning) than the one provided 
in our GitHub section since the newer one would have a more recent WordPress interface to follow. While following along with the 'Wordpress basics' tutorial, I uploaded an image
to my WordPress site and decided to learn more about the 'alt' descriptions for images and how and when to use them. Later on, I found and watched a 'Joomla basics'
video/course on LinkedIn Learning.
